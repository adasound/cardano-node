    "body": "<!-- Introduction -->\r\nNode 1.35.0 adds important functionality that will enable the use of new Plutus capabilities\r\nfollowing the Vasil hard fork, including node and CLI support for:\r\n\r\n- [Reference Inputs (CIP 31)](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip31/)\r\n- [Inline Datums (CIP 32)](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip32/)\r\n- [Reference Scripts (CIP 33)](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip33/)\r\n- [Collateral Output (Draft CIP 40)](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/216)\r\n- Plutus v2 primitives and the associated new cost model\r\n\r\nIt also includes significant improvements to the logging/monitoring, and networking codebases, as well as significant memory and time performance improvements, including the first implementation of diffusion pipelining, and reduced VRF checks, as well as several improvements to the ledger. \r\n\r\n**Please note that this version contains breaking changes, as listed below, specifically with respect to operational certificates\r\non the CLI.  Stake pool operators may need to update their management scripts to accommodate this change.**\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n- With this version, the ledger state will need to be replayed from the genesis block, meaning that the initial synchronisation may be slow.  Users should account for this when deploying the node.\r\n- Restricted opcert issue number increment, as of Babbage. Previously op cert issue numbers could be anything, provided it was larger than previously used numbers. Now the op cert counter must be exactly one more than the previously *used* op cert.\r\n- The decentralisation ('d') updatable protocol parameter has been removed, as of Babbage.  It will no longer be possible to change this from its current setting (fully decentralised).\r\n- Bugfix: transaction validity intervals will actually be limited, as of Babbage.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\nPlease see [here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues?q=label%3Avasil%2Cvasil_blocker+label%3Abug+state%3Aopen) for known issues.\r\nNote that [#4142](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues/4142) might result in poor user experience (replay from genesis).\r\n\r\n# Technical Specification\r\n<details open>\r\n  <summary>Minimum System Requirements</summary>\r\n  \r\n- An Intel or AMD x86 processor with two or more cores, at 1.6GHz or faster (2GHz or faster for a stake pool or relay)\r\n- 16GB of RAM \r\n- 75GB of free storage (100GB recommended for future growth)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Platforms</summary>\r\n\r\n- Linux 64-bit (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS; Mint 19.3, 20; Debian 10.3)\r\n- Windows 64-bit (8.1, 10, 11)\r\n- MacOS 10.13, 10.14, 10.15, 11\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Supported roles</summary>\r\n\r\nPlatform | Block Production | Relay | Client (Desktop)\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nLinux | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: \r\nWindows | :x: | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: \r\nMacOS | :x: | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: \r\n</details>\r\n<details open>\r\n  <summary>Downloads</summary>\r\n\r\n- [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inputoutput/cardano-node)\r\n- [Hydra binaries](https://hydra.iohk.io/build/16159682#tabs-constituents)\r\n    :warning: Please note that due to an issue with syncing, Windows users should ***not*** upgrade to this release\r\n- [Configuration files](https://hydra.iohk.io/build/8111119/download/1/index.html)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n- [Cardano Node documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/)\r\n- [Cardano CLI](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/1.35.0/cardano-cli/README.md)\r\n- [Internal API docs for ledger, consensus and network](https://input-output-hk.github.io/ouroboros-network/)\r\n- [Compatibility matrix](https://docs.cardano.org/tools/comp-matrix)\r\n\r\n# Changelogs\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Node</summary>\r\n\r\n- RTS workaround converting SIGTERM into SIGINT (#3641)\r\n- Install a dummy SIGHUP handler for non p2p mode (#3896)\r\n- Add --shutdown-on-slot-synced test and ensure ExitSuccess (#3670)\r\n- cardano-node: implement --shutdown-on-block-synced (#3932)\r\n- Update dependencies and pins.

In the case of `IsValid` being false and\r\n  failures being present, two events are emitted; the preceding event with\r\n  successful scripts and a `FailedPlutusScriptsEvent` with the details for\r\n  failing scripts. ([#2670](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2670))\r\n- Add an event `TotalAdaPotEvent` which is emitted on the epoch boundary and\r\n  reports the size of the various ADA pots (reserves, treasury, reward pot etc.)\r\n  ([#2797](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2797))\r\n- Disallow the spending of Byron outputs in transactions also spending from\r\n  Plutus V2 locked outputs. Plutus V1 scripts could be spent in the same\r\n  transaction as Byron outputs, but the Byron outputs would not be visible to\r\n  Plutus. ([#2617](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2617))\r\n- Fix a memory leak in the tests. ([#2648](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2648))\r\n- Add a reference for the cost model keys. ([#2635](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2635))\r\n- Specify how seeds are computed, and how a slot is converted to a seed, in the\r\n  Shelley specification. ([#2626](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2626))\r\n- Significant improvements to the benchmarking suite. ([#2668](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2668), [#2669](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2669), [#2699](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2699))\r\n- Fix the pulsing size used for incremental computation of rewards. This should\r\n  result in a more even spread of load over the epoch. ([#2676](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2676))\r\n- Prune the unused `cardano-ledger-example-shelley` package. ([#2693](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2693))\r\n- Add logic to the STS rules to run certain things only if no failures have yet\r\n  been accumulated. This is useful to e.g. avoid evaluating Plutus scripts in places where the transaction is broken. ([#2679](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2679), [#2847](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2847))\r\n- Hide the `CostModel` constructor. The appropriate way to construct a\r\n  `CostModel` is using `costModelParamsToCostModel`. ([#2703](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2703), [#2730](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2730))\r\n- Support querying the set of UTxO entries which are required to process a\r\n  block. This is an important feature required for moving the UTxO onto disk.\r\n  ([#2715](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2715))\r\n- Add support for stashing the AVVM addresses at the Byron/Shelley transition.\r\n  This is slightly annoying work to enable on-disk UTxO, since the AVVM\r\n  addresses must be removed on the Shelley/Allegra boundary, but by the time\r\n  UTxO is on disk (from Shelley onwards) we disallow full queries over the UTxO.\r\n  ([#2728](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2728))\r\n- Remove ledger-based validation of `Datum`. This is now done entirely by Plutus\r\n  on deserialisation. ([#2757](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2757))\r\n- Add documentation on all ledger events. This can be found at\r\n  https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/blob/master/docs/LedgerEvents.md ([#2778](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2778))\r\n- In the Alonzo era, extend the epoch info provided by Plutus to allow time\r\n  translation arbitrarily into the future. This pertains to a bug in consensus\r\n  which was allowing arbitrarily distant translation only in the last era. This\r\n  bug has been fixed, but the ledger must preserve the previous behaviour in the\r\n  existing era. ([#2785](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2785))\r\n- Translate legacy cost mode parameter names in the JSON deserialiser. The\r\n  deserialiser now does not care about the names, only about the ordering of the\r\n  parameters. This is consistent with how cost model parameters are treated in\r\n  update proposals. ([#2792](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2792))\r\n- Ensure pure `EpochInfo` is not overused. ([#2818](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2818))\r\n- Do not serialize empty txbody fields ([#2863](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2863))\r\n- Remove empty `SuccessfulPlutusScriptsEvent` events ([#2861](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2861))\r\n- Disable staking Ptr optimization ([#2875](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2875))\r\n- integrity hash not needed for all ref scripts ([#2878](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2878))\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Network</summary>\r\n\r\n- Multinode Diffusion Simulation ([#3497](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3397))\r\n- Trace exceptions thrown by inboundGovernorLoop ([#3591](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3591))\r\n- Added prop_timeouts_enforced ([#3532](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3532))\r\n- Connection Manager tests using IOSimPOR ([#3632](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3632))\r\n- Don't overwrite localrootpeers lookup results ([#3641](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3641))\r\n- Extract tcp_info for mux tcp bearer ([#3648](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3648))\r\n- IOSim MonadFix instance ([#3647](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3647))\r\n- io-classes: added strict versions of traceTVar & traceTMVar ([#3654](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3654))\r\n- Platform independent TCPInfo trace ([#3660](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3660))\r\n- Connection manager transition order test using IOSimPOR ([#3640](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3640))\r\n- Removed ST effects from IOSimPOR ([#3662](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3662))\r\n- RootPeersDNS: garbage collect DNS results && test single source of truth ([#3643](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3643))\r\n- Enabled accept errors in net-sim testing ([#3668](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3668))\r\n- Update supported protocol versions of cardano-ping\" ([#3700](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3700))\r\n- Add `yield` to `MonadFork` ([#3713](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3713))\r\n- Diffusion Tests ([#3619](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3619), [#3629](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3629), [#3633](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3633), [#3636](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3636), [#3707](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3707), [#3727](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3727), [#3728](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3728), [#3761](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3761))\r\n- cardano-ping: fix misplaced `unless quiet` ([#3729](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3729))\r\n- Import `getMonotonicNSec` from base rather than via FFI ([#3735](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3735))\r\n- connection-manager: mini-protocol params ([#3606](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3606))\r\n- Remove TxSubmission V1 and all node-to-node versions smaller or equal to NodeToNodeV_6 ([#3696](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3696))\r\n- Remove NodeToClientV_8 and below ([#3699](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3699))\r\n- Relax overly strict disconnection rule for known-invalid blocks ([#3726](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3726))\r\n- Moved io-sim & typed-protocols to new repositories ([#3747](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3747))\r\n- Fix NodeToNodeVersion for Babbage and P2P.

(#3320, #3508)\r\n- Tests for certifying and withdrawing Plutus scripts. (#3318)\r\n- Various documentation updates. (#2875, #2884, #2839, #2904, #3476, #3482, #3486, #3500, #3502, #3542, #3553, #3573, #3603)\r\n- Integrate the new tracing system in `cardano-node`. (#3450, #3496, #3497, #3498, #3570)\r\n- The stake credential history tool now additionally displays the protocol version.

([#3404](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3404))\r\n- Stop the MUX in case of miniprotocol timeout. This can happen if a peer is demoted to cold, and could result in lingering miniprotocols in an unknown state if the peer is again promoted. ([#3575](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3575), [#3580](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3580))\r\n- Avoid ordering peers based upon peerid in block fetch. Ordering based on peerid would often result in all nodes choosing the same second, third choice peers etc. These are now based on a node-local random ordering. ([#3535](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3535))\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Cardano-cli</summary>\r\n\r\n- Add a prettier rendering of update proposals. (#3208)\r\n- Add support for CBOR-encoded blobs in the `transaction build` and `transaction build-raw` commands. (#3483)\r\n- Implement a `leadership-schedule` command. This can calculate a stake pool's leadership schedule for the current and following epoch. It requires access to the VRF signing key for that stake pool. (#3464, #3494)\r\n  ```\r\n  > cardano-cli query leadership-schedule \\\r\n     --testnet-magic 42 \\\r\n     --genesis example/shelley/genesis.json \\\r\n     --stake-pool-id  pool12t0y7agkqct89pf00eeytkvfjlquv76tjy27duannan9w63ckxv \\\r\n     --vrf-signing-key-file example/node-pool1/shelley/vrf.skey\r\n     --current\r\n\r\n     SlotNo                          UTC Time\r\n     --------------------------------------------------------\r\n     4073                   2021-12-29 17:26:54.998001755 UTC\r\n     4126                   2021-12-29 17:27:00.298001755 UTC\r\n     4206                   2021-12-29 17:27:08.298001755 UTC\r\n     4256                   2021-12-29 17:27:13.298001755 UTC\r\n     4309                   2021-12-29 17:27:18.598001755 UTC\r\n     4376                   2021-12-29 17:27:25.298001755 UTC\r\n     4423                   2021-12-29 17:27:29.998001755 UTC\r\n     4433                   2021-12-29 17:27:30.998001755 UTC\r\n  ```\r\n- The CLI now supports outputting transaction bodies in ledger-compliant CDDL in the `transaction build` and `transaction build-raw` commands. This is specified by using the `--cddl-format` flag. (#3505)\r\n- Implement a `kes-period-info` command in the CLI. This checks that your operational certificate is correct. It checks:\r\n  - The counters match what is in the node's protocol state\r\n  - The KES period in the operational certificate is correct (based on the current slot). (#3459, #3572, #3599)\r\n  ```\r\n  > cardano-cli query kes-period-info --testnet-magic 42  \\\r\n    --op-cert-file example/node-pool1/shelley/node.cert\r\n  ✓ The operational certificate counter agrees with the node protocol state counter\r\n  ✓ Operational certificate's kes period is within the correct KES period interval\r\n  {\r\n      \"qKesNodeStateOperationalCertificateNumber\": 6,\r\n      \"qKesCurrentKesPeriod\": 404,\r\n      \"qKesOnDiskOperationalCertificateNumber\": 6,\r\n      \"qKesRemainingSlotsInKesPeriod\": 3760228,\r\n      \"qKesMaxKESEvolutions\": 62,\r\n      \"qKesKesKeyExpiry\": \"2022-03-20T21:44:51Z\",\r\n      \"qKesEndKesInterval\": 434,\r\n      \"qKesStartKesInterval\": 372,\r\n      \"qKesSlotsPerKesPeriod\": 129600\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n- The CLI now displays collateral inputs in a nicer fashion. (#3463)\r\n- The `transaction sign` command now allows for incremental signing by providing an already signed transaction via `--tx-file`. This allows more easily adding multiple signatures to a transaction. (#3549)\r\n- The `transaction build` command now supports an option (`--calculate-plutus-script-cost`) to compute the cost for included scripts. (#3589)\r\n  ```\r\n  cardano-cli transaction build \\\r\n  --alonzo-era \\\r\n  --cardano-mode \\\r\n  --testnet-magic \"$TESTNET_MAGIC\" \\\r\n  --change-address \"$utxoaddr\" \\\r\n  --tx-in \"$plutusutxotxin\" \\\r\n  --tx-in-collateral \"$txinCollateral\" \\\r\n  --tx-out \"$dummyaddress+10000000\" \\\r\n  --tx-in-script-file \"$plutusscriptinuse\" \\\r\n  --tx-in-datum-file \"$datumfilepath\"  \\\r\n  --protocol-params-file \"$WORK/pparams.json\" \\\r\n  --tx-in-redeemer-file \"$redeemerfilepath\" \\\r\n  --calculate-plutus-script-cost \"$WORK/create-datum-output.scriptcost\"\r\n\r\n  > cat $WORK/create-datum-output.scriptcost\r\n  [\r\n    {\r\n        \"executionUnits\": {\r\n            \"memory\": 1700,\r\n            \"steps\": 476468\r\n        },\r\n        \"lovelaceCost\": 133,\r\n        \"scriptHash\": \"67f33146617a5e61936081db3b2117cbf59bd2123748f58ac9678656\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n  ``` \r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Cardano-api</summary>\r\n\r\n- Expose `lovelaceToTxOutValue`. (#3381)\r\n- Implement two functions: `currentEpochEligibleLeadershipSlots` and `nextEpochEligibleLeadershipSlots` to get the leadership slots for the current/next epoch respectively. (#3464, #3494)\r\n- Add a `capi` library to support using the cardano node as a C library in other software. (#3501)\r\n- `fromShelleyAddr` now takes an explicit `ShelleyBasedEra` parameter to determine the era. The previous behaviour (with an implicit `IsShelleyBasedEra` constraint) can be obtained with `fromShelleyAddrIsSbe`.

    "body": "<!-- Introduction -->\r\n\r\nCardano Node version 1.33.0 is a performance-focused release, bringing significant improvements in sync time, block propagation time, and reduced memory usage. Incremental stake aggregation and reward calculation allows much more uniform computation across the epoch, reducing the likelihood of spikes in CPU usage during the reward calculation period and so improving the consistency of block production.\r\n\r\nIn addition, more information is provided during node initialisation, and changes have been made to improve the handling of unexpected shutdowns when initialising the node.  DNS support for IPv6 has been added.  Tracing has been provided for Plutus scripts, making it easier to debug failure conditions.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\nWith this version, the ledger state will need to be replayed from the genesis block, meaning that the initial synchronisation may be slow.  Users should account for this when deploying the node.\r\n\r\n# Technical Specification\r\n<details open>\r\n  <summary>Minimum System Requirements</summary>\r\n  \r\n- An Intel or AMD x86 processor with two or more cores, at 1.6GHz or faster (2GHz or faster for a stake pool or relay)\r\n- 12GB of RAM \r\n- 50GB of free storage\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Platforms</summary>\r\n\r\n- Linux 64-bit (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS; Mint 19.3, 20; Debian 10.3)\r\n- Windows 64-bit (8.1, 10, 11)\r\n- MacOS 10.13, 10.14, 10.15, 11\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Supported roles</summary>\r\n\r\nPlatform | Block Production | Relay | Client (Desktop)\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nLinux | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: \r\nWindows | :x: | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: \r\nMacOS | :x: | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: \r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Downloads</summary>\r\n\r\n- [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inputoutput/cardano-node)\r\n- [Hydra binaries](https://hydra.iohk.io/build/9941098#tabs-constituents)\r\n- [Configuration files](https://hydra.iohk.io/build/8111119/download/1/index.html)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n- [Cardano Node documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/)\r\n- [Cardano CLI](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/1.33.0/cardano-cli/README.md)\r\n- [Internal API docs for ledger, consensus and network](https://input-output-hk.github.io/ouroboros-network/)\r\n- [Compatibility matrix](https://docs.cardano.org/tools/comp-matrix)\r\n\r\n# Changelogs\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Node</summary>\r\n\r\n- Improvements to the `tx-generator` internal testing infrastructure.

(#3349)\r\n- Support for using `TxIn` as a key in JSON maps. (#3438)\r\n- Allow configuring the number of connections to accept. (#3435)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Consensus</summary>\r\n\r\n- Move the transitional praos protocol into its own package, in preparation for introducing a new version of the protocol in Babbage. ([#3513](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3513))\r\n- Improve logging during node startup/chainDB initialisation. ([#3505](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3505), [#3506](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3506), [#3518](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3518))\r\n- Various changes to the initialisation of the ChainDB. The intent of these changes is to handle the situation when the node receives a shutdown instruction during initialisation. Before these changes, the node would either fail to respond to the signal until initialisation was complete, or a supervisor process would notice this and send SIGKILL, resulting in an unclean shutdown. Following these changes, the node should gracefully handle signals sent during DB initialisation. ([#3452](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3452), [#3514](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3514))\r\n- Various improvements to the `db-analyser` tool. ([#3471](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3471))\r\n- Expose an additional query for information relevant to reward processing. This offers current-epoch information to help clients make delegation preferences.

([#2524](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2524))\r\n- Provide more information in the case of extraneous script witnesses being provided. ([#2527](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2527))\r\n- Significant work to improve memory usage for the in-memory ledger state. ([#2520](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2520), [#2530](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2530), [#2534](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2534), [#2540](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2540), [#2552](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2552), [#2553](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2553), [#2557](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2557), [#2567](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2567), [#2573](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2573), [#2577](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2577), [#2580](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2580), [#2583](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2583))\r\n- Add a new tool to benchmark the ledger state. ([#2532](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2532), [#2535](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2535))\r\n- Remove the amount of state stored in the reward pulser. This change will require a rebuild of the ledger state (e.g. replay from genesis). ([#2533](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2533))\r\n- Add an additional check when evaluating an (unsubmitted) transaction to determine the amount of ExUnits to specify. ([#2522](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2522))\r\n- Distinguish between rewards earned as a pool member and as a pool operator in the ledger events. ([#2536](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2536), [#2549](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2549))\r\n- From protocol version 7, we no longer exclude from rewards those who are not registered at the start of the reward calculation. Those not registered when the rewards are paid out are still filtered, naturally. ([#2569](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2569))\r\n- Add a stricter function for decoding addresses, which disallows extra bytes. These functions are provided for use by downstream tools. ([#2556](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2556))\r\n- The reward calculation (which adds significant work to the middle portion of the epoch) is now computed incrementally by stake credential. Previously this was done by stake pool, but this had a couple of issues: it didn't allow the computation to be spread across the full range of slots, and it was significantly non-uniform: some stake pools are much bigger than others. This new computation should be more uniform and saturate the full slot range, resulting in more predictable and consistent resource usage. ([#2542](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2542), [#2585](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2585))\r\n- Add benchmarking to CI. ([#2561](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2561), [#2568](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2568))\r\n- Add tracing to Plutus script execution. ([#2554](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2554))\r\n- Add the first draft of the Babbage formal spec. ([#2559](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2559))\r\n- Document the construction of the script integrity hash. ([#2576](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2576))\r\n- Compute the stake aggregation incrementally. Previously this was computed when a snapshot was taken, which resulted in a CPU spike. It is now continually maintained as transactions are processed. ([#2538](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2538))\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Network</summary>\r\n\r\n- Don't block when unregistering expired connections. ([#3526](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3526))\r\n- Fix the rendering of cardano-ping messages. ([#3529](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3529))\r\n- Various improvements to the pruning policy.

    "body": "<!-- Introduction -->\r\n\r\nCardano Node version 1.32.1 introduces a number of improvements and enhancements to improve the usability of the Cardano node.  Native asset name rendering has been changed in order to eliminate problems caused by non-printing characters, CLI commands now default to the Alonzo era, and default values have been added to simplify startup where a genesis file is not supplied (eg in test or standalone settings). Additional logging is available during node startup, enabling progress to be tracked more easily, and statistics counting has been disabled in order to reduce noise.  Limits have been added to mini protocols. There is better rendering of some trace messages.\r\nDocumentation has also been improved in various areas.\r\n\r\n*This version also adds experimental support for peer-to-peer network.  It is **unverified** and **unsupported**, and hence **not recommended** to be enabled in production.*\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n1. _Asset Name Format Change._  **Note that asset names are now output in hex format when querying UTxO entries.  Any user who is relying on asset names to be represented as ASCII text will need to change their tooling.  As a temporary transitional solution, it is possible to use Cardano-cli version 1.31 with node version 1.32.1 if desired, or to continue to use node version 1.31.  This will not be possible following the next hard fork (which is expected in early 2022).**\r\n2. _CLI default era change._ CLI commands now default to the Alonzo era (previously Mary era).  Tooling may need to be revised if it was relying on the default.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Technical Specification\r\n<details open>\r\n  <summary>Minimum System Requirements</summary>\r\n  \r\n- An Intel or AMD x86 processor with two or more cores, at 1.6GHz or faster (2GHz or faster for a stake pool or relay)\r\n- 12GB of RAM\r\n- 30GB of free storage\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Platforms</summary>\r\n\r\n- Linux 64-bit (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS; Mint 19.3, 20; Debian 10.3)\r\n- Windows 64-bit (8.1, 10, 11)\r\n- MacOS 10.13, 10.14, 10.15, 11\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Supported roles</summary>\r\n\r\nPlatform | Block Production | Relay | Client (Desktop)\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nLinux | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: \r\nWindows | :x: | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: \r\nMacOS | :x: | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: \r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Downloads</summary>\r\n\r\n- [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inputoutput/cardano-node)\r\n- [Hydra binaries](https://hydra.iohk.io/build/9116257#tabs-constituents)\r\n- [Configuration files](https://hydra.iohk.io/build/8111119/download/1/index.html)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n- [Cardano Node documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/)\r\n- [Cardano CLI](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/1.32.0/cardano-cli/README.md)\r\n- [Internal API docs for ledger, consensus and network](https://input-output-hk.github.io/ouroboros-network/)\r\n- [Compatibility matrix](https://docs.cardano.org/tools/comp-matrix)\r\n\r\n# Changelogs\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Node</summary>\r\n\r\n- Miscellaneous documentation updates.

It also provides support for improved rewards logging in db-sync, includes a new CLI command to query stake pools, enhances the `transaction build` CLI command, fixes an issue where connections were dropped when using `query tip`, and provides various other CLI enhancements.  It allows signatures to be specified when spending from pre-Plutus time-lock/multi-signature scripts, improves error logging for Plutus scripts, adds new logging modes, allows the size of the mempool to be configured, provides support for multiple versions of Plutus, and improves networking behaviour and robustness.  \r\nIt is recommended that all users upgrade to this new version.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n- Update min utxo calculation cli command #3181\r\n`calculate-min-req-utxo` requires a transaction output (`TxOut era`) instead of a `Value` in order to calculate the min required UTxO in the Alonzo era.

(#3060, #3120, #3142, #3191, #3243, #3265, #3284)\r\n- Introduce the `trace-dispatcher` library. This is built to replace the existing `iohk-monitoring-framework`. (#3073)\r\n- Add an example using a Plutus script as a stake credential. (#3162)\r\n- Don't inline a call to `maybeToStrictMaybe` during translation of `ProtocolParameters`. This turns out to trigger a GHC bug, resulting in extremely high compilation time. (#3275)\r\n- Introduce a YAML version of the mainnet configuration file, which can and has been commented to explain the various options. (#3269)\r\n- Add various additional metrics:\r\n  - About block propagation. (#2476)\r\n  - Tracking how many tips a node has served to downstream peers. (#3300)\r\n  - Counting the number of forks seen. (#3305)\r\n- Add the ability to configure the mempool capacity override. This allows an individual node operator to alter the maximum size of their mempool along various axes (size, execution units).

([#2442](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2442))\r\n- Updates to the Alonzo formal specification. ([#2418](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2418), [#2448](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2448))\r\n- Additional exports needed for db-sync integration. ([#2450](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2450))\r\n- Moved protocol related types to a new module, `cardano-protocol-tpraos`. ([#2445](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2445))\r\n- Preparatory work for storing the ledger state on disk.

([#2313](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2313))\r\n- Providing more information about the reward calculation inside of the reward provenance. ([#2433](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2433))\r\n- Add a `RetiredPools` event, which gives details about retiring pools and the refund (or not) of the pool deposit. ([#2487](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2487), [#2495](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2495))\r\n- Fix the CDDL specification for transactions.

This is done in anticipation of introducing a new version of the consensus protocol in the Babbage release. ([#2491](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2491), [#2505](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2505), [#2510](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2510), [#2516](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2516), [#2518](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2518))\r\n- Document the minimum value computation for Alonzo. ([#2486](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2486))\r\n- Various changes to compactify the in-memory representation of the Cardano ledger state:\r\n  - Unpack the TxId in a transaction input. ([#2501](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2501))\r\n- Add support for V2 of Plutus (and for multiple Plutus versions in general). ([#2485](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2485))\r\n- Expose more information concerning reward computation in the API. This is intended to support revised display of pool rankings in the wallet. ([#2511](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2511))\r\n- Document both `Value` and `TxInfo` in the spec. ([#2383](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2383), [#2494](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2494))\r\n- Fix the serialisation of Alonzo transaction witnesses in the case of multiple Plutus versions. ([#2525](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2525), [#2526](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2526))\r\n- When incrementally computing the rewards, we now require this computation to complete by the first block within 2k/f slots of the epoch end. Previously it was required to complete by the end of the epoch. The motivation for this is to allow db-sync some time to insert the rewards distributed this epoch (which may be substantial) into its database before the end of the epoch. ([#2521](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2521))\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Network</summary>\r\n\r\n- Adding more information to trace events. ([#3333](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3333))\r\n- Work around a bug on OS/X calling `accept` on IPv6 sockets. ([#3368](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3368)\r\n- Continual gradual merge of p2p functionality. ([#3369](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3369), [#3370](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3370), [#3371](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3371), [#3372](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3372), [#3373](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3373), [#3374](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3374), [#3377](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3377))\r\n- Miscellaneous documentation changes. ([#3383](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3383), [#3399](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3399))\r\n- Fix a race condition in the thread tracking set. This could result in a node eventually refusing to accept new connections. ([#3398](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3398))\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Cardano-cli</summary>\r\n\r\n- Allow the user to specify a signature as required when spending from a multisig/timelock script using the `build` or `build-raw` commands. Required signers *must* be present in the witnesses, and only required signers are visible to Plutus scripts. (#3123)\r\n- Use a separate connection for the `query tip` command. This fixes an occasional bug where the `query tip` command would fail. (#3130)\r\n- Print the Tx fee when using the `tx build` command. (#3032)\r\n- The `tx build` command now validates its inputs (ensuring they are in the UTxO and that only basic VKey-locked inputs are used as collateral.) (#3151)\r\n- Add a new comment to query the stake pools. (#3152)\r\n- `tx build` now uses the set of existing stake pools to determine if a pool is already registered (and hence whether it must pay a deposit). (#3152)\r\n- `calculate-min-req-utxo` now requires a transaction output, not just a value as before. This is required in the Alonzo era, and the change is made everywhere for consistency. (#3181)\r\n- Allow the `tx build` command to spend the entirety of a UTxO and create no change output. (#3188)\r\n- Add withdrawals to the `tx view` command. (#2613)\r\n- Restore support for deserialising transactions built by pre-1.27.0 node versions. (#3226)\r\n- Use the new `GetChainBlockNo` and `GetChainPoint` queries in the query tip command. There is a fallback to the older method using the full chain sync query. (#3179)\r\n- Allow provision of optional datums to a transaction using the CLI option `--tx-out-datum-embed-value`. This mechanism can for example be used to provide the actual script locking an output, for use when spending it. (#3171)\r\n- Fix the use of withdrawals using the `transaction build` command. (#3317)\r\n- Allow extended payment keys to be specified as a Plutus required signer. (#3319)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Cardano-api</summary>\r\n\r\n- Improvements to the ledger state API. (#3143)\r\n- Make it easier to use monadic queries. (#3151)\r\n- Implement `getBlockHeader` for Alonzo. This was a stray function that got missed when implementing Alonzo in the API. (#3158)\r\n- A few additional exports for API consumers. (#3156)\r\n- Expose ledger events through the API. Ledger events provide a way for consumers to receive details about things that are happening inside the ledger, and will be used by tools such as db-sync. (#3085)\r\n- Improve the error message reported when you try to spend a non-Plutus locked input using a Plutus script. (#3187)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Deprecated features</summary>\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Fixed issues</summary>\r\n\r\n- Fix the configuration of the `chainSyncServerHeaderTracer`. This fixes a bug which caused logs to be unnecessarily verbose. (#3252)\r\n- Fixed a bug that could cause a node to become unresponsive to new connections.

Those include a functional fix that makes it safe to call the function that generates a public key from a private key concurrently. We only use those functions in the CLI, in a non-concurrent manner, but they are exposed in `cardano-api`. This fix ensures that custom code written against `cardano-api` behaves as expected when run in multiple threads.

    "body": "This release is an important update to the node that provides the functionality that is needed following the Alonzo hard fork.\r\n**All users, including stake pool operators, must upgrade to this version (or a later version) of the node.**\r\n\r\nThe release includes features that will enable the use of the node in the Alonzo era, allowing the on-chain execution of Plutus scripts,\r\nincluding extended CLI commands to support the construction of transactions that include Plutus scripts, datums and redeemers.\r\nIt incorporates several improvements, including a new `transaction build` command that calculates transaction fees and Plutus script execution units, and a new version of the `query tip` command that provides additional information, including node synchronisation progress. The `transaction build` command requires a local instance of the node in order to check Plutus script validity and to provide information that is used by the fee calculation. The Shelley specification has also been updated with respect to rewards calculation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that this release changes the log format of traces configured by `TraceChainSyncHeaderServer` and `TraceChainSyncClient` . See #2746 for more detail.\r\n\r\n- When migrating to 1.29.0, SPOs need to make the following changes:\r\n   - Download `mainnet-alonzo-genesis.json` file\r\n   - Update `mainnet-config.json` file to include the following 2 lines:\r\n```\r\n  \"AlonzoGenesisFile\": \"mainnet-alonzo-genesis.json\",\r\n  \"AlonzoGenesisHash\": \"7e94a15f55d1e82d10f09203fa1d40f8eede58fd8066542cf6566008068ed874\",\r\n```\r\n## Node changes\r\n- Introduce support for running an Alonzo node. (#2642, #2649, #2657, #2738, #2759)\r\n- Add a separate genesis file for Alonzo. This must be present when forking to the Alonzo era. It provides initial configuration for new parameters required in Alonzo, such as cost models and pricing for Plutus scripts. (#2743, #2765)\r\n- Update the genesis hash mismatch error for Alonzo. (#3003)\r\n- Add `cardano-tx-generator`. This is a testing utility. (#2603)\r\n- Add additional capabilities to the tx generator:\r\n   - Plutus. (#2853)\r\n   - Fees and UTxO. (#2980)\r\n   - Miscellaneous bugfixes. (#3015)\r\n- Introduce the trace-forward library, which is part of the replacement for the logging infrastructure. (#2960)\r\n- Add the difference in chain length to the `AddedToCurrentChain` and `SwitchedToAFork` traces. (#2678)\r\n- Additional block hashes added to `TraceBlockFetchServerSendBlock`, `TraceForgedBlock`, `CompletedBlockFetch` events. (#2710)\r\n- The various `ChainSync` server traces provide additional fields that help in debugging. Note that this entails a change to the log format. (#2746)\r\n- Various documentation updates. (#2681, #2689, #2713, #2837, #2857, #2860, #2870, #2874, #2914, #2933)\r\n- Various build, testing and benchmarking infrastructure improvements. (#2672, #2676, #2682, #2705, #2719, #2722, #2730, #2737, #2748, #2766, #2768, #2777, #2796, #2812, #2813, #2826, #2827, #2831, #2832, #2833, #2849, #2855, #2861, #2864, #2865, #2866, #2879, #2887, #2888, #2894, #2900, #2902, #2909, #2912)\r\n\r\n## Consensus changes\r\n- Introduce the Alonzo era. ([#3131](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3131), [#3138](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3138))\r\n- Enable the Alzono era by default. ([#3295](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3295))\r\n- Additional testing in the Alonzo era. ([#3191](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3191), [#3210](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3210))\r\n- Allow the EpochInfo provided to the ledger to fail. This is necessary when the ledger may be querying for time conversions outside of the forecast window. ([#3098](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3098))\r\n- The mempool now checks bounds on the capacity of execution units allowed when forging a new block. This is needed to avoid trying to create invalid blocks in Alonzo. ([#3224](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3224))\r\n- Allow the node to modify the maximum capacity of the mempool, in terms of various factors (size, execution units) on a per-node basis. ([#3238](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3238), [#3246](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3246), [#3261](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3261), [#3266](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3266))\r\n- Update the mempool design for compatibility with Alonzo, which requires some additional logic to deal with 2-phase validation. ([#3066](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3066))\r\n- Update consensus documentation. ([#3071](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3071), [#3155](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3155), [#3195](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3195))\r\n- Updates to the io-sim testing infrastructure. ([#3076](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3076), [#3172](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3172), [#3196](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3196), [#3222](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3222))\r\n- Node to client queries are now wrapped in a top-level versioned `Query` type, in preparation for adding new queries to the node. ([#3106](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3106))\r\n- Support additional queries now exposed through the API/CLI. ([#3220](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3220))\r\n- Documentation updates.  ([#3269](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3269), [#3273](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3273))\r\n- Reject invalid scripts coming from the local wallet. This is a fallback measure which allows the node to protect the user from accidentally losing their collateral. ([#3230](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3230))\r\n\r\n## Ledger changes\r\n- Implementation of the Alonzo era. ([#2260](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2260), [#2264](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2264), [#2265](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2265), [#2270](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2270), [#2273](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2273), [#2274](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2274), [#2277](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2277), [#2283](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2283), [#2287](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2287), [#2294](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2294), [#2295](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2295), [#2296](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2296), [#2299](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2299), [#2302](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2302), [#2303](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2303), [#2304](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2304), [#2305](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2305), [#2306](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2306), [#2317](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2317), [#2320](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2320), [#2322](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2322), [#2324](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2324), [#2328](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2328), [#2329](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2329), [#2335](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2335), [#2342](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2342), [#2345](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2345), [#2355](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2355), [#2359](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2359))\r\n- Define the CDDL for Alonzo datatypes. ([#2281](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2281), [#2315](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2315), [#2337](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2337), [#2362](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2362))\r\n- Testing work for the Alonzo era. ([#2259](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2259), [#2261](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2261), [#2263](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2263), [#2272](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2272), [#2275](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2275), [#2279](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2279), [#2280](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2280), [#2293](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2293), [#2311](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2311), [#2334](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2334), [#2340](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2340), [#2361](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2361)) \r\n- Additional testing for serialisation of types which are depended on by consensus. ([#2298](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2298), [#2323](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2323))\r\n- Add the ability to query the UTxO by TxIn, which is now used by the CLI. ([#2331](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2331))\r\n- Updates to the Alonzo formal specification. ([#2353](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2353), [#2258](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2258), [#2271](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2271), [#2341](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2341))\r\n- Rename the IsValidating field in Alonzo to IsValid. ([#2396](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2396))\r\n- Testing for the Alonzo era. ([#2348](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2348), [#2380](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2380), [#2390](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2390))\r\n- Update the Alonzo Tx to include the validity flag, which will now be passed by the client and other nodes. ([#2379](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2379))\r\n- Add the ability to convert from slot time to UTC time within the forecast window. This will be necessary for Plutus scripts. ([#2297](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2297))\r\n- Fix the version of Plutus to be used in release. (([#2369](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2369), [#2372](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2372), [#2384](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2384), [#2420](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2420), [#2425](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2425))\r\n- Canonically encode the subset of protocol parameters presented to Plutus scripts. Since this is not user-provided, but instead generated by the node, we need to use the canonical encoding here. ([#2357](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2357))\r\n- Add utilities for computing the transaction fee, for use in the CLI. ([#2376](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2376))\r\n- Improved error message when collateral fails. ([#2409](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2409))\r\n- Add reporting of why Plutus scripts fail, sufficient to locally reproduce the failure. ([#2386](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2386), [#2430](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2430))\r\n- Expanded benchmarks for performance critical functions. ([#2262](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2262))\r\n- Introduce the event logger. This allows the ledger to emit extra information during normal operation for the use of downstream components. The initial use of this will be for db-sync to validate its computation of rewards. ([#2373](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2373), [#2405](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2405), [#2417](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2417), [#2431](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2431))\r\n- Add utilities to measure ExUnits in order to allow consensus to apply block-level limits. ([#2391](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2391))\r\n- Disallow extra redeemers in the witness set. ([#2392](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2392), [#2393](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2393))\r\n- Allow script stake credentials to earn rewards. ([#2400](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2400))\r\n- Updated the Shelley spec with an image depicting the reward process and the various phases it goes through. ([#2282](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2282))\r\n- Add an errata to the Shelley spec, which addresses:\r\n  - Reward calculation & stake addresses registration timing.\r\n  - Add a note about Byron redeem addresses being returned to the reserves.\r\n  - Define precisely how reward aggregation works.\r\n  - A discrepancy in the use of the Stability window between the spec and the\r\n    implementation.\r\n  - The use of the incorrect reserve pot when creating the reward update.\r\n  ([#2323](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2323))\r\n- Align the Shelley spec with code. ([#2339](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2339))\r\n- Restrict the pool metadata hash to the correct size for such a hash. ([#2358](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2358))\r\n\r\n## Network changes\r\n- Work on the network-mux. ([#2999](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2999), [#3100](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3100), [#3121](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3121), [#3160](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3160), [#3166](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3166), [#3193](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3193), [#3204](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3204))\r\n- Add an additional tracer to the BlockFetch protocol. ([#3190](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3190))\r\n- Monitor exceptions thrown by the accept loop. This addresses an issue where the accept loop could die and the node stop accepting connections. ([#3299](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3299), [#3305](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3305))\r\n- Update the specification document. ([#3257](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3257))\r\n- Update network documentation. ([#2887](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2887), [#3071](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3071), [#3089](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3089), [#3126](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3126), [#3217](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3217))\r\n\r\n## Cardano-cli changes\r\n- The query tip command is now tidier (#2885) and shows additional information:\r\n  - The epoch number is now shown during the Byron era.  Previously this worked only in the Shelley and subsequent eras. (#2688)  \r\n- Attempting to use an IPv6/IPv4 address where the other is expected will now give a more helpful error message. (#2691)\r\n- Queries should now work during the Alonzo era. (#2727, #2755)\r\n- Support for submitting transactions during the Alonzo era. (#2774, #2798, #2806, #2811, #2823, #2863, #2848)\r\n- `cardano-cli genesis create` now also creates the new Alonzo genesis file. (#2743)\r\n- The UTxO CLI query now allows an additional `--tx-in` flag which allows filtering the UTxO by TxIn, and requires the addition of the `--whole-utxo` flag to return the complete UTxO set (which was previously the default). Returning the whole UTxO set is an expensive operation only useful in small testnets, so we don't want it as the default option. (#2843, #2854)\r\n- The parser for rational units (as used in for example execution unit prices) now supports rational syntax (e.g. 1/2). (#2922)\r\n- Add a \"tx build\" command to the CLI. This command takes care of calculating the appropriate fee for a transaction, and balancing the transaction appropriately. It does not do input selection for fees, so sufficient balance must be available in the inputs to pay the computed fee, and sufficient collateral must also be present when phase-2 validating scripts are used. The tx build command is capable of computing both the fees required from transaction size and the fees incurred by script execution. (#2921, #2953, #2995, #3025)\r\nImprove the output format for rational fields in protocol parameters and genesis. When these are simple, we now convert them to decimal format. (#2992)\r\n- Improved formatting of the CLI help text. (#2945)\r\n- Introduce the `--script-valid` and `--script-invalid` flags. The latter can be used to mark a script as being known invalid, such that the node will allow it to be submitted anyway (whereas under normal operation it would reject such a transaction in order to avoid loss of collateral). This flag is only likely to be of use in testing. The --script-valid flag is set as a default. (#3050, #3091, #3093)\r\n- Add colours to the CLI output. (#3023)\r\n\r\n## Cardano-api changes\r\n- Support for the Alonzo era, including protocol parameters, Plutus scripts and collateral inputs. (#2784, #2798, #2808, #2810, #2815, #2818, #2823, #2828)\r\n- Add support for querying the Alonzo ledger state. (#2974)\r\n- Add a function 'getTransactionBodyContent'. This extracts a general view of the TxBody from the era-specific bodies. (#2663)\r\n- Add API support for new node queries:\r\n  - `QuerySystemStart` gets the system start time.\r\n  - `QueryStakePools` and `QueryStakePoolParameters` can be used to get details on the currently known stake pools.\r\n  - `QueryUTxOFilter` provides various ways to query a filtered subset of the UTxO.\r\n  (#2843)\r\n- Add functions to the API to assist in automated transaction building:\r\n  - `evaluateTransactionBalance` computes the current balance of a (partial) transaction, which is helpful for determining what needs to be done to correctly balance it (such that value produced equals value consumed).\r\n  - `evaluateTransactionExecutionUnits` computes how many ExUnits will be needed by all the scripts in a (partial) transaction.\r\n  - `evaluateTransactionFee` computes the fee for a (partial) transaction, assuming a given number of VKey witnesses (corresponding to inputs).\r\n  - `estimateTransactionKeyWitnessCount` attempts to estimate the number of VKey witnesses needed.\r\n  - `makeTransactionBodyAutoBalance` attempts to create and automatically balance a transaction body, using the above tools.\r\n  (#2906)\r\n- Support for automated Tx building. (#2953)\r\n- A few additional exports for API consumers. (#3001, #3055)\r\n- Block folding interface now derives the network ID automatically from the ledger config. (#2955, #2975)\r\n- Improve the error generated when a Tx output does not meet the minimum UTxO value. (#3027)\r\n- Update the API documentation.\r\n\r\n## Deprecated Features\r\n\r\n\r\n## Fixed Issues\r\n- Fix a bug in deserialisation of witnesses. This would allow for somebody to include signatures of something other than the transaction body, which would not be deserialised and hence could persist on the chain. Unfortunately we have to continue to allow this in pre-Alonzo eras since it has been observed on the public testnet.

    "body": "Node version 1.27.0 provides important new functionality, including supporting new CLI commands that have been requested by stake pools, providing garbage collection metrics.\r\nIt includes the performance fixes for the epoch boundary calculation that were released in node version [1.26.2](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.26.2), plus a number of bug fixes and code improvements.\r\nIt also includes many fundamental changes that are needed to prepare for forthcoming feature releases (notably Plutus scripts in the Alonzo era).\r\nNote that this release includes breaking changes to the API and CLI commands, and that compilation using GHC version 8.6.5 is no longer supported.\r\n\r\n### API refactoring to move scripts into the txbody (#2547)\r\nThere are some breaking changes:\r\n- You must specify auxiliary scripts with --auxiliary-script-file instead of --script-file\r\n- Scripts witnessing txins, certificates, withdrawals and minting must be paired with the thing they are witnessing.\r\nE.g:\r\n```\r\n--certificate-file  $certfile --certificate-script-file $scriptfile\r\n--tx-out $txout --minting-script-file $scriptfile\r\n--withdrawal $withdrawal --withdrawal-script-file $scriptfile\r\n--tx-in $txin --txin-script-file $scriptfile\r\n```\r\n- Scripts are no longer specified at the tx signing stage. They are specified at the txbody stage.\r\n\r\n## Node changes\r\n\r\n- Add an additional GC heap metric to RTS. (#2592)\r\n- Add details about registering relays on-chain to SPO documentation. (#2591)\r\n- Improved installation documentation. (#2624)\r\n- Preparatory support for Voltaire. (#2498)\r\n- Add a docker image option for downloading cardano-node. (#2632)\r\n\r\n## Consensus changes\r\n\r\n- Some preparation for upcoming work on Voltaire. ([#2978](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2978))\r\n- Introduce an option to configure the snapshot interval. This will primarily be used by downstream teams for testing and benchmarking. ([#2966](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2966)), ([#3092](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3092))\r\n- Preparatory work for the implementation of Ouroboros Genesis. ([#3002](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3002))\r\n- Add a peer label to chain sync client traces, allowing us to view which peer supplied which header and when. ([#3091](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3091))\r\n- Provide the ledger with the ability to perform slot to time conversion. This will be needed for Plutus scripts in the upcoming Alonzo release. ([#3036](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3036)), ([#3098](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3098))\r\n\r\n## Ledger changes\r\n\r\n- Work on implementing the upcoming Alonzo era.

([#2236](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2236)), ([#2252](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2252))\r\n- Expose AdaPots for use in downstream projects. ([#2208](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2208))\r\n- Some preparation for upcoming work on Voltaire. (#2135)([#2135](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2135))\r\n\r\n## Network changes\r\n\r\n- Introduce new representation for local root peers. This is in preparation for P2P support. ([#3006](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3006))\r\n- Add a new KeepAlive codec that produces a valid CBOR encoding. ([#3062](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3062))\r\n\r\n## Cardano-cli changes\r\n- The query tip now also returns the era (e.g. Shelley, Allegra, Alonzo). (#2561, #2562, #2598)\r\n- The address build command now incorporates the functionality of the script address build command, which is now deprecated. (#2486, #2587)\r\n- Add additional commands for creating MIR certificates to the CLI. This supports the ability to transfer funds to the treasury for Catalyst projects. (#2503)\r\n- The transaction view command now additionally shows detailed of minted non-native tokens. (#2550)\r\n- Add a new command which computes the minimum ADA value/deposit for a multi-asset value. (#2612)\r\n- Add two new query commands:\r\n   - Query stake-snapshot allows querying the three stake snapshots for a given stake pool.\r\n   - Query pool-params returns the current and future parameters, as well as the retiring information.

([#2238](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2238))\r\n- Removed support for Byron addresses using the Bech32 encoding. The only supported way to use Byron-era addresses is through a file, using the text envelope format. (#2605)\r\n\r\n## Fixed Issues\r\n- Fixes to the ShelleyMA formal specification. ([#2181](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2181))\r\n- Fix a bug in reward update application which could have resulted in the wrong amount of funds being added to the treasury.

    "body": "This release includes significant performance improvements and numerous other minor improvements and feature additions. In particular the reward calculation pause is eliminated, and the CPU load for relays handling lots of incoming transactions should be significantly reduced.\r\nThe focus of the current development work is on completing and integrating support for the Alonzo era. This release includes many of the internal changes but does not yet include support for the new era.\r\n\r\n- Note that this release will automatically perform a DB migration on the first startup after the update. The **migration should take 10-20 minutes** however it can take up to 60 minutes depending on your CPU. If this is a problem for your use, then see below for steps to mitigate this.\r\n- The format of the `cardano-cli query tip` query has changed - see release notes for the CLI below.\r\n- The `cardano-cli query ledger-state` query now produces a binary file if `--out-file` is specified.  If required (e.g. for use in `cncli`), JSON output can be obtained by omitting this parameter, and redirecting the standard output to a file\r\n\r\n### Steps to mitigate downtime for this update\r\n\r\nThis release will automatically perform a DB migration on the first startup after the update. The migration should take 10-20 minutes however it can take up to 60 minutes depending on your CPU.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate downtime:\r\n1. Update a non-production mainnet node\r\n2. Take a DB snapshot\r\n3. Stop production node\r\n4. Backup and replace DB with snapshot\r\n5. Restart production node on 1.26.1\r\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for all production nodes\r\n\r\nSee [#311](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ops/pull/311) for example scripts of how this can be done.\r\n\r\n## Node changes\r\n- Expanded documentation for Windows builds (#1993, #2231)\r\n- Other expanded and updated documentation (#2308, #2334, #2342, #2347, #2429, #2431, #2432, #2434, #2435, #2442)\r\n- Simplified configuration for working with RTView (#2303)\r\n- Prototype reporting metrics to EKG directly, rather than via the switchboard. (#2355)\r\n- Multiple improvements to the configuration when running cardano-node as a Nixos service. (#2374, #2384, #2389, #2404, #2418, #2424, #2436, #2443, #2483)\r\n- KES metrics are now traced even when the KES key has expired. This should make it easier for users to detect whether they have an expired KES key. (#2373)\r\n- Add a metric to display the number of forged blocks \"lost\" due to switching to an alternative fork. (#2321)\r\n- Set a flag which enables early return of memory to the OS. This should help in accurate reporting of memory consumption. (#2493, #2495)\r\n- Disable the \"uncoupled blocks\" metric. This was shown in profiling to have an unfortunately large overhead. This reverts the change introduced in #2321. (#2510)\r\n\r\n## Consensus changes\r\n- Add some additional tracing infrastructure ([#2874](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2874))\r\n- Continued work on the technical report of the consensus and storate layer ([#2939](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2939)), ([#2943](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2943))\r\n- Add the ability to query a node to determine whether it issued a block. This supports the \"blocks lost due to switching\" metric mentioned in the node changes above. ([#2930](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2930))\r\n\r\n## Ledger changes\r\n- Update the calculation of rewards to be done progressively, spreading the additional CPU load across a number of days. This should resolve the slowdown 4k/f slots into the epoch which has been seen by a number of node operators. ([#2142](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2142)), ([#2183](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2183))\r\n- Changed the aggregation of rewards, such that we store more data about reward provenance. This makes it easier for downstream applications to show e.g. where rewards come from. ([#2117](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2117)), ([#2123](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2123)), ([#2164](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2164))\r\n- Updates to the Alonzo formal specification ([#2108](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2108)), ([#2189](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2189)), ([#2194](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2194))\r\n- A lot of work on implementing the upcoming Alonzo era ([#2124](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2124)), ([#2127](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2127)), ([#2148](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2148)), ([#2161](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2161)), ([#2165](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2165)), ([#2166](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2166)), ([#2169](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2169)), ([#2170](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2170)), ([#2176](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2176)), ([#2185](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2185)), ([#2190](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2190))\r\n- Add the ability for MIR certificates to transfer money from the reserves to/from the treasury. This will be used to support Catalyst funding. ([#2146](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2146))\r\n- Additional properties added to the Mary/Allegra formal specification ([#2178](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2178))\r\n\r\n## Network changes\r\n- Various changes to support P2P ([#2526](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2526)), ([#2911](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2911)), ([#2921](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2921))\r\n- The LocalStQuery and ChainSync protocols now allow for additional effects to take place once the client has acquired a connection. This should allow for additional pipelining in clients such as the wallet. ([#2896](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2896))\r\n- Various tracing improvements:\r\n   - Trace termination of mini-protocols ([#2924](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2924))\r\n   - Additional tracing of transaction submission ([#2924](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2924))\r\n- Allow configuring the timeouts for protocol handshakes. This should serve to mitigate a potential attack where handshakes are begun but not concluded, occupying resources on the node. ([#2990](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2990))\r\n- Add a tracer for the delay between when a block should have been forged and when we're ready to adopt it. ([#2995](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2995))\r\n\r\n## Cardano-cli changes\r\n- Add three new queries to the CLI, exposing functionality already present in the API:\r\n   - Protocol parameters\r\n   - Stake distribution\r\n   - Individual stake addresses (#2275, #2290)\r\n- Add the ability to calculate the minimum deposit needed for a transaction to the CLI, given a value. (#2325)\r\n- Add cardano-cli transaction view, which allows for pretty-printing details about a serialised transaction. (#2348)\r\n- When constructing MIR certificates, the CLI now takes stake addresses rather than stake certificates. These are strictly more general and can be deduced from the certificates.\r\n- Make the Mary era the default era in the CLI (#2415)\r\n- Migrate the cardano-submit-api tool from cardano-rest. (#2370)\r\n- The 'tip' query now additionally returns the epoch at the tip. Some of the names of fields returned have changed and will need to be modified accordingly:\r\n  - \"blockNo\" is now \"block\"\r\n  - \"slotNo\" is now \"slot\"\r\n  - \"headerHash\" is now \"hash\"\r\n  (#2440)\r\n- It's no longer possible to specify the era when making a CLI query, and it will default to the current era. (#2470)\r\n- The 'ledger-state' query now outputs its result as a binary file if '--out-file' is specified\r\n\r\n## Cardano-api changes\r\n- When querying the NodeLocalState, make the query point optional, and use the chain tip when not specified. (#2241)\r\n- The cardano-submit-api now takes transactions encoded as CBOR rather than JSON. This reverts a change to existing behaviour for backwards compatibility. (#2491, #2512)\r\n- Remove a backwards-compatibility workaround related to the optional query point (#2241 above) when querying the NodeLocalState. This had resulted in spurious notifications of disconnection in the logs. Note that as a consequence of this, instances of the CLI and other tools using the 1.26.1 API will fail to query node state from older versions of the node. (#2540)\r\n\r\n## Deprecated Features\r\n- Removed code pertaining to the old IPC API (#2319)\r\n- Support for GHC 8.6.5 has been dropped. (#2507)\r\n\r\n## Fixed Issues\r\n- Fix the rendering of Byron-era TxOuts to be consistent with the rendering for Shelley-era addresses. (#2472) \r\n- Fixed a performance regression in the Allegra and Mary eras. This resulted in node slowdown when validating failed transactions. ([#2144](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2144)) \r\n- Fixed a subtle bug in reward computations, where the wrong amount of money would be added to the treasury. ([#2136](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2136))\r\n- Fix RTS options, which got accidentally corrupted in the previous release. (#2511)\r\n- Update the iohk-monitoring framework to fix a file descriptor leak. (#2518)\r\n- Fix an unevalutated thunk error in reward computation.

    "body": "This release is expected to be the final release for the upcoming Mary hard fork, and everyone ***must*** upgrade to this (or a later) version to cross the Mary hard fork.\r\n\r\nThe Mary hard fork introduces native token functionality to Cardano. This is directly useful and is also one of the significant building blocks for the later Goguen smart contracts.\r\n\r\nA launchpad testnet for the native token functionality has been running since December, using the cardano-node 1.24.2 release. This 1.25.1 release contains relatively minor changes for the Mary era compared to the 1.24.2 release. It is nevertheless not compatible with the 1.24.2 version and the existing testnet. The launchpad testnet ***will not*** be restarted and will remain on 1.24.2. Public testnet and staging have been upgraded to 1.25.1. If you have already tested integration with the existing launchpad testnet then no new integration work is expected for this release other than upgrading the node version and moving to the staging or public testnet.\r\n\r\nExchanges and other users that integrate closely with Cardano **must take action** to test their integration before the transition takes place on mainnet. Exchanges can use launchpad or staging, SPOs can use staging, and everyone should use public testnet once it forks. Staging will go through the Mary hard fork on 28th January, and public testnet will go through the Mary hard fork during week commencing 1st February. The native token functionality does have an impact for all custom wallet implementations: it is not a feature that can be ignored and remain compatible. All addresses are capable of receiving native tokens.\r\n\r\nStake Pool Operators (SPOs) and Exchanges should take note that the metric namespace has undergone consolidation, so all metrics now reside in `cardano.node.metrics`:\r\n- cardano.node.Forge.metrics.* -> cardano.node.metrics.Forge.*\r\n- cardano.node.ChainDB.metrics.* -> cardano.node.metrics.ChainDB.*\r\n- cardano.node.BlockFetchDecision.connectedPeers -> cardano.node.metrics.connectedPeers\r\n\r\nThe node configs require no changes, but allow dropping entries that became redundant: wherever `cardano.node.Forge.metrics.*`, `cardano.node.ChainDB.metrics.*` or `cardano.node.BlockFetchDecision.connectedPeers` were mentioned, those entries can be removed.  Only `cardano.node.metric` needs to remain. Please see #2281 for further details.\r\n\r\nThis release uses a new cabal snapshot so could be rather resource intensive when building for the first time.\r\n\r\n## Node changes\r\n- All metrics now use a common name prefix `cardano.node.metrics`. This requires a one-off change to the node configuration to route all metrics to the metrics backend and not have them in the log files. This should reduce the number of such changes in future. (#2281)\r\n- More detailed tracer output for protocol tracers (#2178)\r\n\r\n## Consensus changes\r\n- Improve the handling of the encoding of local IPC queries by older clients that do not understand later hard forks. In future this should mean that clients that do not understand a hard fork only fail at the time of the hard fork itself, and not earlier when the update proposal is confirmed ([#2818](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2818))\r\n- New query for rewards provenance. This is intended to help wallets explain more details about rewards, and to help SPOs and users better understand how pools' performance and ranking are calculated. This is not yet supported in the CLI in this release. ([#2830](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2830))\r\n- Support for using multiple leader credentials for the purpose of running large scale benchmarks. It supported in testnets only, not mainnet ([#2832](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2832))\r\n- Support in testnets for skipping initial eras. This makes it easier and quicker to automate the setup of Cardano-mode testnets that start in later eras, such as Allegra or Mary. This enables simplifications in the setup for integration tests or benchmarks ([#2811](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2811)) \r\n- A first draft of a technical report on the design and the internals of the Cardano consensus and storage layer ([#2663](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2663), [#2838](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2838), [#2841](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2841), [#2842](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2842), [#2853](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2853))\r\n\r\n## Ledger changes\r\n- Enforce the size of multi-asset names, to match the specification ([#2074](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2074))\r\n- Minor change to the ledger CDDL binary specification for the Mary era: restrict the range of multi-asset values to -2^63..2^63-1 where previously the allowed range was -2^64..2^64-1 ([#2092](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2092))\r\n- Rename fields in the ledger's CDDL binary specification for clarity and consistency, but no actual changes to the binary format ([#2045](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2045))\r\n- Change the minimum ada UTxO value formula for multi-asset values to better reflect the resource costs and to pass on savings (in the form of a lower minimum ada UTxO value) for applications that use smaller asset bundles by sharing policy ids or using shorter asset names ([#2107](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2107))\r\n- Improvements to the size of the internal storage format of multi-asset values, enabling a lower minimum ada UTxO value for multi-asset output values ([#2083](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2083))\r\n- Restrict the maximum size of multi-asset output values ([#2099](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2099))\r\n- Terminology change: the metadata section is renamed to \"auxiliary data\" to distinguish it from the existing transaction metadata ([#2052](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2052))\r\n- Extra documentation on native tokens ([#2046](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2046))\r\n- Progress on the new Alonzo era ([#2022](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2022), [#2055](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2055), [#2061](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2061), [#2062](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2062), [#2067](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2067), [#2077](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2077), [#2087](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2087), [#2088](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2088), [#2095](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2095))\r\n\r\n## Network changes\r\n- Internal infrastructure to support seeding the P2P graph construction from the SPO relays registered on the chain, weighted by stake ([#2535](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2535), [#2536](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2536))\r\n- Introduce v6 of the node-to-node protocol where we reverse the initial agency of the tx-submission protocol to match the others. This is preparation for the P2P governor which requires the initial agency for mini-protocols to be uniform ([#2807](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2807))\r\n- Introduce v8 of the node-to-client protocol with an extension to the local query protocol that allows acquiring the point at the node's current chain tip, without having to provide that point explicitly. Using this simplifies things for node clients for the common use case where the current tip is needed, and eliminates a rare race condition ([#2875](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2875))\r\n- Fix a resource leak for chain-sync clients ([#2235](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2235), [#2870](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2870), [#2888](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2888))\r\n- Tracing improvements for the mux component ([#2794](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2794))\r\n\r\n## Cardano-cli changes\r\n- Allow creating transactions with no outputs (#2223, #2226)\r\n- Improved error messages for syntax errors in out-of-range lovelace quantities in transaction outputs (#2063, #2079)\r\n- Improved reference documentation for simple scripts and their use (#2165)\r\n- Remove support for changing the delegation from Genesis keys to operational keys in the Byron era. This feature was never used on the mainnet during the Byron era. (#2219)\r\n- Clearer usage information in the CLI --help output (#2203)\r\n\r\n## Cardano-api changes\r\n- New IPC modules for easier interaction with the node, including support for all existing local state queries (#2230, #2238, #2263, #2277, #2286)\r\n- API support for Byron era update proposals and votes (#2209, #2271)\r\n- Make Cardano.Api the primary public module for the API.\r\n- API support for serialising multi-asset PolicyId and AssetName (#2270)\r\n- API for pretty-printing JSON output (#2103)\r\n- More precise error cases for tx outputs that are out of range (#2217)\r\n- Host up-to-date generated API documentation via github https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-node/ (#2273, #2276, #2278)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n- [Cardano Node documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/)\r\n- [Cardano CLI](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/1.25.1/cardano-cli/README.md)\r\n- [Internal API docs for ledger, consensus and network](https://input-output-hk.github.io/ouroboros-network/)\r\n- [Configuration files](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/en/latest/stake-pool-operations/getConfigFiles_AND_Connect.html)\r\n\r\n## Platforms\r\n- Linux 64-bit (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS; Mint 19.3, 20; Debian 10.3)\r\n- Windows 64-bit (8.1, 10)\r\n- MacOS 10.13, 10.14, 10.15\r\n- [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inputoutput/cardano-node)\r\n\r\n## Supported roles\r\nPlatform | Block Production | Relay | Client (Desktop)\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nLinux | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ \r\nWindows | :x: | :x: | ✔️ \r\nMacOS | :x: | :x: | ✔️ \r\n\r\n## Minimum System Requirements\r\n- An Intel or AMD x86 processor with two or more cores, at 1.6GHz or faster (2GHz or faster for a stake pool or relay)\r\n- 4GB of RAM (8GB for a relay or stake pool)\r\n- 10GB of free storage (20GB for a stake pool)\r\n\r\n## Sign off\r\n<!-- Signatures of people responsible for the release -->\r\nRole | Approval\r\n-- | --\r\nTechnical Lead | ✔️  \r\nQA Engineer | ✔️ \r\nOps | ✔️ \r\nRelease Manager | ✔️ "

    "body": "This release provides support for the upcoming Allegra (token locking) Hard Fork and Mary Hard Fork and the new features they bring.\r\n\r\nEveryone ***must*** upgrade to this (or a later) version to cross the Allegra Hard Fork.\r\nDaedalus users should look for Daedalus release 3.0.0 which includes a version of the node that will cross the Token locking Cardano update, however people using the node directly must upgrade.\r\n\r\n* Token locking Cardano update adds some features needed to support the Catalyst treasury scheme. It extends the existing multi-sig script language with predicates for time, via the slot number. It allows, for example, to make a script address that is not spendable until a certain point in time.\r\n* The native tokens Cardano update adds multi-asset support. This is comparable to ERC20 and ERC721 tokens, but supported natively in the UTxO ledger. This is part of the Goguen feature set. It is a very significant feature and will have implications for all Cardano wallet implementations, including exchanges.\r\n\r\nStake Pool Operators (SPOs) and Exchanges should update their node config \"options\" section with an extra entry:\r\n```\r\n  \"options\": {\r\n    \"mapBackends\": {\r\n      \"cardano.node.resources\": [\r\n        \"EKGViewBK\"\r\n      ],\r\n```\r\nSee link to configuration files in documentation section below.\r\n\r\n## Node changes\r\n- Add a nodeStartTime metric. This is a partial replacement for the uptime metric that was removed in the 1.23.0 release. (#2118)\r\n- New metrics for the size of the UTxO and delegation maps (#2158)\r\n- Tracing changes to support \"K=1000\" benchmarks (#2156, #2175)\r\n- Mention the required xz tool in the Cabal build instructions (#2132)\r\n- Eliminate the need to update the `LastKnownBlockVersion-*` entries in the node config files for the Shelley-based eras. This means the configuration does not need to be updated for the Token locking or native tokens eras. (#2193)\r\n- Export some more metrics for selected OS and RTS stats (#2192)\r\n\r\n## Ledger changes\r\n- Support for optional additional scripts in the tx auxiliary data ([#1993](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1993))\r\n- Update the CDDL specification of the blockchain binary format for Token locking and native tokens eras ([#1994](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1994), [#1999](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1999), [#2009](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2009))\r\n- Improved serialised binary format for multi-asset values ([#1979](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1979))\r\n- Add a compact in-memory storage format for multi-asset values ([#1996](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1996))\r\n- Updates to the multi-asset formal specifiation ([#2003](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2003))\r\n- Adjust how the major protocol version is handled for soft forks ([#1998](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1998))\r\n- Initial preparatory steps for the Alonzo era ([#2016](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2016), [#2027](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2027))\r\n- Benchmarks for the transaction generators ([#2024](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2024))\r\n\r\n## Consensus changes\r\n- Use a single set of credentials for all Shelley-based eras. This keeps the node configuration simple for the new eras. ([#2753](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2753))\r\n- Add support for a token locking-only protocol mode to simplify benchmarking ([#2754](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2754))\r\n- Add support for the system wall clock time being adjusted backwards by a small amount without triggering a node shutdown and restart. Small backwards adjustments can be caused by NTP. ([#2781](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2781), [#2785](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2785))\r\n\r\n## Network changes\r\n- Preparations for publishing io-sim as a public library ([#2775](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2775))\r\n- Improved logging of the creation of the node's sockets ([#2746](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2746))\r\n- Update the cardano-ping tool to support the node-to-node protocol V4 ([#2787](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2787))\r\n\r\n## CLI changes\r\n- CLI support for the Token locking  and native tokens eras, including creating transactions for the new eras, and support for the special new features in the new eras: script extensions, tx validity intervals, auxiliary scripts, multi-asset tx outputs and asset minting. (#2072, #2129, #2136)\r\n- It is now necessary to specify the target era (e.g. --allegra-era) when creating a transaction (with build-raw) so that the right format and feature-set is used. The --shelley-era remains the default.\r\n- It is necessary for now to specify the target era when using the CLI query commands. This may become automatic in future. The default is --shelley-era.\r\n- Move all the Shelley sub-commands to the top level of the command line. For example `cardano-cli shelley transaction build-raw` becomes simply `cardano-cli transaction build-raw`. The existing names are also kept for compatibility. (#2076, #2145)\r\n- Updated help text for the ledger/protocol state queries to clarify that they are primarily for debugging and are not stable interfaces (#2125, #2126, #2133)\r\n- New command `transaction policyid` for making multi-asset policy ids (#2176)\r\n- New command `byron transaction txid` to help scripts with getting the transaction id for Byron transactions made using the cli (#2169)\r\n- New `--tx-file` flag for the command `transaction txid` to accept complete txs, not just tx bodies (#2169)\r\n- Hide the deprecated `--ttl` flag in the `--help` output (#2189, #2190)\r\n\r\n## API changes\r\n- Full API support for the Token locking and native tokens eras, including creating transactions for the new eras, and support for the special new features in the new eras: script extensions, tx validity intervals, auxiliary scripts, multi-asset tx outputs and asset minting (#2092, #2110, #2111, #2121, #2127, #2128, #2141, #2149)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n- [Cardano Node documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/)\r\n- [Cardano CLI](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/1.24.2/cardano-cli/README.md)\r\n- [Internal API docs for ledger, consensus and network](https://input-output-hk.github.io/ouroboros-network/)\r\n- [Configuration files](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/en/latest/stake-pool-operations/getConfigFiles_AND_Connect.html)\r\n## Platforms\r\n\r\n- Linux 64-bit (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS; Mint 19.3, 20; Debian 10.3)\r\n- Windows 64-bit (8.1, 10)\r\n- MacOS 10.13, 10.14, 10.15\r\n- [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inputoutput/cardano-node)\r\n\r\n## Minimum System Requirements\r\n\r\n- An Intel or AMD x86 processor with two or more cores, at 1.6GHz or faster (2GHz or faster for a stake pool or relay)\r\n- 4GB of RAM (8GB for a relay or stake pool)\r\n- 10GB of free storage (20GB for a stake pool)\r\n\r\n## Sign off\r\n<!-- Signatures of people responsible for the release -->\r\nRole | Approval\r\n-- | --\r\nTechnical Lead |✔️\r\nQA Engineer | ✔️ \r\nOps | ✔️\r\nRelease Manager |✔️"

    "body": "This release includes a substantial amount of internal changes to support the upcoming Allegra and Mary hard forks and the new features they bring. This is *not* the final release before the Allegra hard fork, but it does include the bulk of the functionality for both Allegra and Mary hard forks.\r\n\r\n * The Allegra hard fork adds some features needed to support the Catalyst treasury scheme. It extends the existing multi-sig script language with predicates for time, via the slot number. It allows, for example, to make an address not spendable until a certain point in time.\r\n * The Mary hard fork adds multi-asset support.

It is a very significant feature and will have implications for all Cardano wallet implementations, including exchanges.\r\n\r\nAnother notable change in this release is an adjustment to the pool ranking that will benefit small pools that have not yet made many blocks. We have adjusted the initial Bayesian prior so that instead of assuming new pools will perform at some less-than-perfect average level, we assume they will perform more-or-less perfectly. This prior is still updated based on the actual performance history, so pools that perform poorly will still drop in ranking. This change will especially benefit small pools that have produce few blocks so far, because they have very little performance history and so their score will be more influenced by the initial prior.\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n- Preliminary support for the upcoming Allegra and Mary eras ([#1899](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1899), [#1951](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1951), [#1958](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1958), [#1959](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1959), [#1961](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1961), [#1965](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1965), [#1971](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1971), [#1977](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1977), [#1981](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1981), [#1984](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1984), [#1987](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1987), [#1988](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1988), [#1989](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1989), [#1990](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1990), #2019, #2038, #2080, [#2666](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/2666), [#2668](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2668), [#2670](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2670), [#2677](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2677), [#2679](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2679))\r\n- Preliminary support for the Allegra script language extensions ([#1847](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1847), [#1875](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1875), [#1895](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1895), [#1908](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1908), #2069)\r\n- Preliminary support for the Mary multi-asset extensions ([#1905](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1905), [#1931](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1931), [#1938](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1938) #2081, #2083, #2085, #2093)\r\n- Adjust how the pool performance is estimated as part of the pool ranking: for pools with no performance history use a Bayesian prior that assumes that pools will perform well. This should benefit new small pools. ([#1936](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1936))\r\n- Adjust the ledger state dump to return the \"extended\" ledger state (#2019)\r\n- Support bech32 and hex formats for reading verification keys (#1852)\r\n- Improved documentation for CLI multi-signature support (#1976)\r\n- Improve handling of invalid command line input (#2088)\r\n- Improved ledger state serialisation performance ([#1968](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1968))\r\n- Restore build compatibility with GHC 8.6.5, so this release builds with both GHC 8.6.5 and 8.10.2.

This makes it easier to handle ledger-only era changes that still use the same Praos consensus protocol. ([#1915](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1915))\r\n- Support serialisation for the Shelley genesis data structure to support a new node query that can return the genesis parameters ([#1927](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1927))\r\n- New cardano-ping demo and tool ([#2701](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2701))\r\n- Make the node fail on startup if we cannot bind to the necessary ports ([#2696](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2696))\r\n- Improvement to the calculation and collection of network connection performance metrics ([#2636](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2636))\r\n- Improvements to the handling of the initial connection handshake ([#2691](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2691))\r\n- Preparations for publishing io-sim as a public library ([#2580](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2580), [#2631](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2631), [#2649](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2649))\r\n- Improved IPv6 support (#1928, [#2662](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2662))\r\n- Preparation for the p2p governor: add a new node-to-node protocol version (4) with a new negotiated handshake parameter to determine if the connection will be uni-directional or bi-directional ([#2658](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2658))\r\n- Documentation for the hard fork transition (#1741)\r\n- Check VRF signing key files have the correct file permissions (#1936, #1938)\r\n- Improve IPv6 support and related internal refactoring (#1928)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Resolved issues\r\n- Fix a space leak in the stake pool performance tracking that caused writing ledger state snapshots in consensus to take too long ([#1967](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1967))\r\n- Fix a corner case in the way the pool performance history is calculated as part of the overall pool score calculation ([#1897](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1897))\r\n- Fix a failure that occurs on starting a node when there are certain kinds of DB corruption (specifically a ledger snapshot that is newer than the tip of the immutable DB, which would typically occur when chain DB files are manually moved or removed) ([#2651](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2651))\r\n- Fix a long-standing (highly unlikely) bug in evaluating alternative chains that cross a hard fork boundary ([#2314](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2314), [#2318](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2318), [#2657](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2657), [#2661](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2661))\r\n\r\n## Deprecated Features\r\n- Remove the HardForkNotBeforeEpoch setting from the config file (#2073, [#2736](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2736), [#2739](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2739))\r\n- Remove the deprecated LiveView feature, now that RTView is released (#1977)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n- #1734 ErrorPolicyUnhandledApplicationException may be observed when running CLI commands on windows\r\n- See GitHub Issues for further issues that have been reported\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n- [Cardano Node documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/)\r\n- [Cardano CLI](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/1.21.1/cardano-cli/README.md)\r\n- [Internal API docs for ledger, consensus and network](https://input-output-hk.github.io/ouroboros-network/)\r\n\r\n## Platforms\r\n\r\n- Linux 64-bit (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS; Mint 19.3, 20; Debian 10.3)\r\n- Windows 64-bit (8.1, 10)\r\n- MacOS 10.13, 10.14, 10.15\r\n- [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inputoutput/cardano-node)\r\n\r\n## Minimum System Requirements\r\n\r\n- An Intel or AMD x86 processor with two or more cores, at 1.6GHz or faster (2GHz or faster for a stake pool or relay)\r\n- 4GB of RAM (8GB for a relay or stake pool)\r\n- 10GB of free storage (20GB for a stake pool)\r\n\r\nRole | Approval\r\n-- | --\r\nTechnical Lead | :heavy_check_mark:\r\nQA Engineer | :heavy_check_mark:\r\nOps | :heavy_check_mark:\r\nRelease Manager | :heavy_check_mark:\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The new RT View component will be released separately. The Live View mode is still available in this release of the node, but will be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n- Added support for multi-signature scripts in the node CLI and API (#1788, #1880)\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n- Added support in Byron witnesses for addresses that use attributes, which include all addresses in legacy Daedalus Byron wallets (#1851, #1871)\r\n- Optimised the expensive reward calculations while checking if the node is the slot leader, which significantly reduce the CPU spike at the 48 hour point in each epoch ([#2642](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2642))\r\n- Added initial support for hard forks after Shelley ([#2452](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/2452), [#2471](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/2471))\r\n- Added support for a low-impact soft fork with stricter metadata validation ([#1874](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1874))\r\n- Adjusted the outstanding data limit for the block fetch protocol ([#2624](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2624))\r\n- Improved protocol logging ([#2609](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/2609), [#2610](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/2610), [#2618](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/2618), [#2611](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/2611))\r\n- Added trace for ledger events during DB replay ([#2508](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/2508), [#2621](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/2621), [#2627](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/2627))\r\n- Added further improvements to the performance of reward calculations and some other ledger calculations ([#1857](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1857), [#1881](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1881), [#1884](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1884))\r\n- Updated the formal specification with the change in the overlay schedule calculation ([#1862](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1862))\r\n- Made minor corrections to the formal specification arising from internal review and internal audit ([#1776](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1776), [#1808](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1808), [#1811](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1811), [#1820](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1820), [#1861](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1861))\r\n- Documented the meaning of the MIR pot field in the CDDL chain specification ([#1864](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1864))\r\n- Updated documentation on the details of pool ranking ([#1852](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1852))\r\n- Fixed the mux protocol description and typos in the network documentation ([#2625](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2625), [#2639](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2639))\r\n- Added information about the RT View component that will replace Live View in the node documentation (#1866)\r\n\r\n## Deprecated features\r\n- Live View mode of Cardano node\r\n\r\n## Removed features\r\n- Removed `stack` build support ([#2638](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2638))\r\n\r\n## Resolved issues\r\n- Fixed a bug in crossing the hard fork from Byron to Shelley ([#2455](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2455), [#2626](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2626))\r\n- Fixed a bug in the calculation of the pool stake fraction reported in the stake pool query used by wallets ([#1880](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1880))\r\n- Fixed a bug for the corner case for testnets where all value is in the reserves with no value in circulation ([#1876](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1876))\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- #1734 ErrorPolicyUnhandledApplicationException may be observed when running CLI commands on windows \r\n- See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) for further issues that have been reported\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n* [Cardano Node documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/)\r\n* [Cardano CLI](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/1.21.0/cardano-cli/README.md)\r\n* [Internal API docs for ledger, consensus and network](https://input-output-hk.github.io/ouroboros-network/)\r\n\r\n## Platforms\r\n* Linux 64-bit (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS;

    "body": "This release is light on user-visible changes as the development has been focusing on preparations for the multi-asset features and on paying down technical debt. It does however include a number of performance improvements in the node, a few new CLI commands, and an improvement that will enable [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) to report stake pool saturation.\r\n\r\nNote that this release will automatically perform a DB migration on the first startup after the update. The **migration will take 10-20 minutes** depending on your CPU. If this is a problem for your use, then see below for steps to mitigate this.\r\n\r\nDeployed on the testnet on  21 September 2020.\r\nDeployed on the mainnet on 23 September 2020.\r\n\r\n### Steps to mitigate downtime for this update\r\n\r\nThis update includes a change in the format of a part of the chain DB (specifically the ledger state snapshots). The migration for this is handled automatically by the node on startup. The migration will take 10-20 minutes depending on your CPU.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate downtime:\r\n1. Update a non-production mainnet node\r\n2. Take a DB snapshot\r\n3. Stop production node\r\n4. Backup and replace DB with snapshot\r\n5. Restart production node on 1.20.0\r\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for all production nodes\r\n\r\nSee [#311](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ops/pull/311) for example scripts of how this can be done.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n- New CLI command `convert-cardano-address-key` for converting more legacy signing key formats (#1756, #1822)\r\n- New CLI command `create-genesis-key-delegation-certificate` for creating genesis key delegation certificates (#1784)\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n- Adjusted the query used by the wallet to report pool stake to report it as a fraction of total stake rather than as a fraction of total supply, enabling it to be used to report pool saturation ([#1836](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1836), [#1850](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1850))\r\n- Adjusted the same query to report pool size based on the live stake distribution rather than the stake distribution snapshot from the last epoch boundary snapshot, enabling its use in the wallet for live reporting of pool saturation ([#1854](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1854))\r\n- Introduced optimisations in the consensus layer leading to approximately a 15% synchronisation time improvement ([#2555](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2555))\r\n- Optimised performance in the ledger for the end-of-epoch reward calculation, to reduce the CPU spike at the 48 hour point in each epoch ([#1851](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1851))\r\n- Made performance and memory improvement in the overlay schedule of the ledger layer ([#1849](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1849))\r\n- Added a new document on the details of pool ranking ([#1816](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1816/))\r\n- Improved support for conversion between JSON and transaction metadata, with support for two JSON schemas, suitable for different use cases (#1797)\r\n- Added sanity checks for the Shelley genesis on node start-up to help with configuring private testnets (#1149, #1478, #1820)\r\n- Added CLI support for bech32 and hex formats when reading signing keys (#1790)\r\n- Improved error messages for CLI errors (#1801, #1839)\r\n- Improved logging message for DB events (#576, #1819)\r\n- Added a script for a node that connects to the current mainnet (#1847)\r\n- Bundled the benchmarking scripts (#1810)\r\n\r\n## Resolved issues\r\n- Fixed a bug in the time (slot/era) node query ([#2579](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2579))\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- #1734 ErrorPolicyUnhandledApplicationException may be observed when running CLI commands on windows \r\n- See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) for further issues that have been reported\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n* [Cardano Node documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/)\r\n* [Cardano CLI](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/1.20.0/cardano-cli/README.md)\r\n* [Internal API docs for ledger, consensus and network](https://input-output-hk.github.io/ouroboros-network/)\r\n* [Making a Shelley blockchain from scratch](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/1.20.0/doc/reference/shelley-genesis.md)\r\n* [Cardano tutorials](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-tutorials) \r\n\r\n## Platforms\r\n* Linux 64-bit (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS; Mint 19.3, 20; Debian 10.3) \r\n* Windows 8.1, 10 64 bit\r\n* [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inputoutput/cardano-node)\r\n\r\n## Minimum System Requirements\r\n* An Intel or AMD x86 processor with two or more cores, at 1.6GHz or faster (2GHz or faster for a stake pool or relay)\r\n* 4GB of RAM (8GB for a relay or stake pool)\r\n* 10GB of free storage (20GB for a stake pool)\r\n\r\n## Sign off\r\n<!-- Signatures of people responsible for the release -->\r\n\r\nRole                      | Approval\r\n---                         | ---:\r\nTechnical Lead      | :heavy_check_mark: \r\nQA Engineer         | :heavy_check_mark:\r\nOps                      | :heavy_check_mark:\r\nRelease Manager | :heavy_check_mark:\r\n"

    "body": "This is the final planned release before the Shelley hard fork. **It is necessary to use this 1.18.0 version to successfully cross the hard fork.**\r\n\r\nThis release delivers the complete set of Shelley features together with the mechanism that will be used to transition from the federated Byron era to the decentralised Shelley era (the hard-fork combinator).\r\n\r\nImportant new features include:\r\n* use of the hard-fork combinator to enable the transition between the Byron and Shelley eras,\r\n* witnesses for spending from Byron addresses in Shelley era transactions,\r\n* numerous improvements and resolved issues.\r\n\r\nTo support the new Cardano mainnet, a new configuration mode for the node has been introduced: the \"Cardano\" mode uses the hard-fork combinator to provide a single mode that is the sequential composition of the two current eras (Byron;Shelley).  This will also be used for future versions of the node, allowing easy transitions between future eras. If you plan to use a manually configured node on the mainnet, it is crucial to use the `Protocol: Cardano` mode and the correct `ShelleyGenesisHash` in the node configuration file.\r\n\r\nNew [Cardano documentation site](https://docs.cardano.org/) with [cardano-node documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/en/latest/) is now available. The [specific configuration](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node#network-configuration-genesis-and-topology-files) to run a node on mainnet or any of the testnets is also available. Note that it is necessary to use the exact Shelley genesis file to successfully cross the hard fork, and it is highly recommended to include that hash in the node configuration file, as in the provided sample configuration.\r\n\r\nThe [1.15.0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.15.0), [1.15.1](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.15.1), [1.16.0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.16.0), [1.17.0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.17.0) tagged versions were not released for general use, however, for applications that were successfully integrated against [1.16.0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.16.0) or [1.17.0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.17.0), this release should be a drop-in replacement: there are no client interface changes compared to the unreleased [1.16.0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.16.0) or [1.17.0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.17.0) tags. In particular, the node's client protocols and transaction formats are unchanged since [1.16.0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.16.0).\r\n\r\nDeployed on the testnet on

instructions, including libsodium (#1325, #1361, #1362)\r\n- Added tracing of hard fork transition events (#1520, [#2449](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2449/))\r\n- Added script for setting up a local cluster in Cardano mode (#1487)\r\n- Improved error reporting ([#2458](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2458))\r\n- Tuned defaultDiskPolicy ([#2454](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2454))\r\n- Improved documentation (#1533, #1534, #1536, #1537)\r\n\r\n## Shelley breaking changes \r\n- A number of changes have been made to the blockchain protocol that mean that this version of the node is not compatible with previous versions\r\n- The hash of the Shelley genesis file is checked on node startup and is incorporated into the initial Praos epoch nonce - care must be taken to preserve the Shelley genesis file content. All instances that are running on the same network must use the same genesis file.\r\n\r\n## Resolved issues\r\n- Fixed query compatibility between Cardano and Byron modes ([#2385](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2385))\r\n- Fixed an off-by-one error in the KES certificate validity period ([#2306](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2306))\r\n- Fixed a number of bugs that have been found by the hard fork tests ([#2310](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/2310), [#2312](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2312))\r\n- Fixed the selection of the epoch nonce ([#1651](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1651))\r\n- Fixed minor design specification description mistake ([#1612](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1612))\r\n- Fixed the documentation of the size of key hashes ([#1622](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1622))\r\n- Fixed a bug in the pool reaping that could cause a crash on epoch boundaries ([#1593](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1593))\r\n- Fixed a preservation of value bug in the rewards that are given to retired stake pools ([#1598](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1598), [#1604](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1604))\r\n- Fixed a bug in pool reaping when multiple pools share a reward account ([#1605](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1605))\r\n- Fixed the calculation of non-myopic rewards that is queried by the wallet ([#1601](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1601))\r\n- Fixed the presentation of pool metadata hashes in JSON output ([#1596](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1596))\r\n- Fixed the output of the `calculate-min-fee` command (#1401, #1408)\r\n- Fixed the format of Byron addresses used in Byron CLI commands (#1326)\r\n- Fixed KES metric reporting in the Cardano mode (#1448, #1505)\r\n- Fixed rendering of block hashes in logging output (#1488)\r\n- Fixed a bug in the serialisation for the Shelley-only era  ([#2435](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2435/))\r\n- Fixed an accidental change to the delegation update rule ([#1701](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1701))\r\n- Fixed serialisation of protocol state to be valid CBOR ([#1684](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1684))\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- High CPU usage can be observed under some conditions when syncing\r\n- There are a number of issues with LiveView - other monitoring systems are preferred\r\n- In some situations, the node may fail to shutdown properly on Windows (#1086) \r\n- There may be issues with creating blocks on epoch boundaries \r\n- The CLI does not yet support multi-signature transactions\r\n- The CLI supports only basic transaction construction\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n* [Cardano Node documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/)\r\n* [Cardano CLI](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/1.17.0/README.md#cardano-cli)\r\n* [Internal API docs for ledger, consensus and network](https://input-output-hk.github.io/ouroboros-network/)\r\n* [Making a Shelley blockchain from scratch](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/1.17.0/doc/shelley-genesis.md)\r\n* [Shelley testnet tutorial](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-tutorials/blob/master/Shelley-testnet/README.md)\r\n\r\n## Platforms\r\n* Linux 64-bit (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS; Mint 19.3, 20; Debian 10.3) \r\n* Windows 8.1, 10 64 bit\r\n* MacOS 10.13, 10.14, 10.15\r\n* [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inputoutput/cardano-node)\r\n\r\n## Minimum System Requirements\r\n* An Intel or AMD x86 processor with two or more cores, at 1.6GHz or faster (2GHz or faster for a stake pool or relay)\r\n* 4GB of RAM (8GB for a relay or stake pool)\r\n* 10GB of free storage (20GB for a stake pool)\r\n\r\n## Sign off\r\n<!-- Signatures of people responsible for the release -->\r\n\r\nRole                      | Approval\r\n---                         | ---:\r\nTechnical Lead      |  :heavy_check_mark: \r\nQA Engineer         |  :heavy_check_mark: \r\nOps                      | :heavy_check_mark: \r\nRelease Manager | :heavy_check_mark: \r\n"

    "body": "# Cardano Node 1.14.0\r\n\r\nThis release delivers new and refined CLI commands, support for transaction metadata, the new ledger minimum pool cost feature, and enhancements to pool rankings. It also includes a new implementation of the VRF cryptography primitives, improvements in the `KeepAlive` network mini-protocol, the Byron-to-Shelley hard-fork implementation, block fetch calculation, logging and reporting, and simplified Docker image usage.\r\n\r\nThere are Shelley breaking changes in this release including changes in the implementation of address hash and VRF cryptography primitives, and removal of the decaying deposit feature. The Shelley features have been pre-released for public testing and review on the re-spawn of [Cardano Shelley Testnet](https://testnets.cardano.org/en/shelley/overview/). The Shelley changes are not available in the Byron mode.\r\n\r\nDeployed on the [Shelley testnet](https://testnets.cardano.org/en/shelley/overview/) on 23 June 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Shelley new features\r\n- A minimum pool cost ledger feature as a protocol parameter `minPoolCost` ([#1539](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/issues/1539), [#1546](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1546))\r\n- New option for transaction metadata  `--metadata-file` for transaction construction using the `build-raw` command  (#1038, #1233) \r\n- New flag for reward account withdrawals `--withdrawal`  in transaction construction  (#1117, #1237) \r\n- New command for pool metadata JSON validation and hashing `metadata-hash` (#1207, #1234, #1299)\r\n- New flags for pool metadata: `--pool-metadata-file`, used in `metadata-hash` command, and `--metadata-url`, `--metadata-hash`, used in the pool registration certificate command `registration-certificate` (#1234)\r\n- New flags for pool relays `--multi-host-pool-relay`, `--single-host-pool-relay`, `--pool-relay-port` in pool registration certificate command `registration-certificate` (#1282, #1296) \r\n- New command `convert-itn-key` to convert ITN keys ([#1070](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues/1070), [#1136](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/pull/1136/)) \r\n- New command `txid` to get the transaction id of a transaction body (#1231)\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n- Adjusted logging verbosity defaults (#1225)\r\n- Added logging of warnings and alerts for certificate expiry (#1228)\r\n- Added reporting number of missed opportunities to make blocks in the live view (#1202)\r\n- Allowed overriding the hostname using the environment variable `CARDANO_NODE_LOGGING_HOSTNAME` (#1278)\r\n- Changed timeouts for chain synchronisation to be drawn from a Praos-specific distribution ([#2249](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2249))\r\n- Improved `KeepAlive` network mini-protocol ([#2230](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2230)) for apps with scheduled stop\r\n- Added support for restarting mini-protocols ([#2205](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/2205), [#2221](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2221), [#2286](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2286))\r\n- Adjusted and simplified the block fetch calculation for determining the current mode - deadline mode or bulk sync mode ([#2267](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2267))\r\n- Shelley ledger changes:\r\n  - Improved track of historical pool performance for pool ranking ([#1565](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1565))\r\n  - Added support of pool ranking with hypothetical amount to delegate ([#1543](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1543))\r\n  - Improved genesis JSON support in the ledger ([#1534](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1534), [#1536](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1536))\r\n  - Added genesis JSON support for initial stake pools and delegation ([#1552](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1552))\r\n  - Added benchmarks and optimisations ([#1527](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1527), [#1566](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1566))\r\n  - Updated the formal specification to cover MIR certificates drawing from the treasury ([#1526](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1526))\r\n  - Updated the design specification address terminology, and multi-sig ([#1547](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1547), [#1554](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1554))\r\n  - Updated the design specification on stake pool metadata ([#1507](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1507))\r\n- ⚠️ Simplified the Docker image usage: `cardano-node` is used now as the entry-point, aligning with the existing interface of the underlying service, and removing the convention of mounting volumes into specified directories. As a result, previously pre-set arguments including, but not limited to `--config` or `--socket-path`, now need to be passed at runtime based on user specific configuration. See the [diff](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/pull/1317/files#diff-229f95a34283f35b010e59092f2297b7L88-L96) and [inline description](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/46f296f8a9f3f497d9bd41e20c8398d2b5730c86/nix/docker.nix#L1-L25) for more info. The quickstart mode of passing a `NETWORK` environment is not impacted by this change\" (#1317). This is a breaking change. Customised (other than testnet and mainnet) Docker image build may fail\r\n\r\n## Shelley breaking changes ⚠️ \r\n - Changed the ledger state dump query to return the whole state ([#2288](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2288))\r\n  - Changed address hashes to be 224 bit, according to the design spec ([#1549](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1549))\r\n  - Updated to the latest VRF API changes ([#1527](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1527))\r\n  - Removed the decaying deposits feature. Deposits are returned in full ([#1512](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1512))\r\n  - Removed unnecessary pool relay port number override in DNS SRV case ([#1570](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1570))\r\n\r\n## Resolved issues\r\n- Fixed a minor regression in the logging so all tracers are configurable (#1192)\r\n- Fixed reporting of git revision in `cardano-node --version` command (#1263)\r\n- Fixed genesis JSON conversion of fractional values to preserve precision ([#1569](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/1569))\r\n- Fixed the query stake-address-info to accept stake addresses (#1197, #1194)\r\n- Fixed return exit code for transaction submission failures (#1226)\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n ### Shelley testnet-specific Issues\r\n* Incorrect genesis settings may result in the node not connecting as expected\r\n* There are still a number of performance issues that need to be addressed\r\n* There are various issues with logging and monitoring\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n* [Cardano CLI](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/1.14.0/README.md#cardano-cli)\r\n* [Internal API docs for ledger, consensus and network](https://input-output-hk.github.io/ouroboros-network/)\r\n* [Making a Shelley blockchain from scratch](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/1.14.0/doc/shelley-genesis.md)\r\n* [Shelley testnet tutorial](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-tutorials/blob/master/Shelley-testnet/README.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Platforms\r\n* Linux 64-bit, Windows 64 bit\r\n* [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inputoutput/cardano-node)\r\n\r\n## Sign off\r\n<!-- Signatures of people responsible for the release -->\r\n\r\nRole                      | Approval\r\n---                         | ---:\r\nTechnical Lead      |  :heavy_check_mark: \r\nQA Engineer         | :heavy_check_mark:\r\nOps                      | :heavy_check_mark:\r\nRelease Manager | :heavy_check_mark:\r\n"

    "body": "# Cardano Node 1.13.0\r\n\r\nThis release completes  the development of many core Shelley features and provides basic Shelley functionality for stake pools and delegation. It delivers new CLI commands for obtaining Shelley stake pool information and creating MIR certificates, a new network `KeepAlive` mini-protocol. It also prepares the Cardano blockchain for the Byron-to-Shelley hard fork operational change that will deactivate Byron mode and will enable the Shelley decentralised mode.  This release also includes improvements in existing Shelley CLI commands, as well as in KES and VRF cryptographic key processing, Praos chain selection and hard fork implementation.  In addition, logging, tracing, error messages and documentation have been improved, and a few outstanding issues have been fixed, notably, an issue that was causing high CPU usage on MacOS.\r\n\r\nThe Shelley features have been pre-released for public testing and review on the [Cardano Shelley Testnet](https://testnets.cardano.org/en/shelley/overview/).\r\nThey are not available in the Byron mode, and are, therefore, deactivated on the Cardano mainnet. \r\n\r\nDeployed on the [Shelley testnet](https://testnets.cardano.org/en/shelley/overview/) on 5 June 2020.\r\nDeployed on the mainnet on 9 June 2020.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n- New commands in the node CLI:\r\n  - to query stake addresses, balance and delegation (#1053, #1129)\r\n  - to get the stake pool id (#1069)\r\n  - to create MIR certificates (#1075)\r\n- New `KeepAlive` network mini-protocol ([#2175](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2175))\r\n- New monitoring metric for KES key periods, including remaining ones (#1030, #1144)\r\n- New local ledger state query to get the current state of stake addresses, namely, their reward account balance, and current delegation choice (if any) ([#2161](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2161))\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n- Changed the Shelley CLI command and flag names to be more consistent (#1068)\r\n- Improved logging for mempool transaction validation failures (#1035)\r\n- Added logging of the epoch number as well as the slot number (#1108)\r\n- Fixed logging of node information on startup (#1122)\r\n- Extended tracing for benchmarking analysis (#1091)\r\n- Improved human readable error messages for Shelley commands (#1021)\r\n- Improved error message for transaction input parser errors (#1066)\r\n- Updated _Making Shelley blockchain from scratch_ documentation (#1062)\r\n- Improved hard fork implementation ([#2139](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2139), [#2150](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2150), [#2151](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2151), [#2152](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2152), [#2158](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2158), [#2165](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2165), [#2177](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2177), [#2183](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2183), [#2192](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2192), [#2199](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2199)) \r\n- Prepared for the Byron-to-Shelley hard-fork ([#2163](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2163), [#2145](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2145), [#2182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2182), [#2185](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2185), [#2187](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2187))\r\n- Changed the Praos protocol chain selection rule to be deterministic based on the chain values (using the leader VRF key) rather than relying on the order of arrival;

    "body": "# Cardano Node 1.11.0\r\nThis release delivers full Windows support, and incremental improvements to the node in Byron mode, including improvements in logging, reduced disk I/O and network error handling improvements.\r\n\r\nMost of the current development focus is on the Shelley mode. This release includes the initial integration of the Shelley ledger and Ourboros Praos consensus within the node. The Shelley features are not available in the Byron mode, and so not available on the Cardano mainnet. For the curious: following releases will include the CLI tools needed to run the node in Shelley mode locally.\r\n\r\nDeployed on the mainnet on 28 April 2020.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n- An option to log output in readable text form, rather than structured (#760)\r\n- Up-to-date generated internal API documentation https://input-output-hk.github.io/ouroboros-network/\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n- Improved performance in logging&monitoring system (#831)\r\n- Suppressed high frequency logging output during syncing (#773)\r\n- Improved example configuration for \"live view\" (#827)\r\n- Improved READMEs  (#793, #828)\r\n- Verification of avoidance of excessive memory use in inbound transaction path ([#1645](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/1645), [#1708](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1708)) \r\n- Improved restart times by storing a ledger snapshot after a long replay ([#1956](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1956))\r\n- Renamed immutable chain DB files from `.epoch` to `.chunk` (with an automatic migration) ([#1755](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/1755), [#1954](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1954))\r\n- Minor disk I/O optimisation when serving headers and blocks ([#1978](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1978))\r\n- Enabled local state query protocol with a V2 local IPC protocol ([#1522](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1522))\r\n- Improved API for the local node IPC protocol ([#1950](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/1950), [#1959](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1959), [#1962](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1962))\r\n- Added timeouts on message sends (in addition to the existing timeouts of receive) ([#1953](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1953))\r\n\r\n## Resolved issues\r\n- Fixed handling of unknown versions in protocol version negotiation ([#1981](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1981))\r\n- Fixed DNS error handling improvements during temporary network outages ([#1960](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/1960), [#1961](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1961))\r\n\r\n### Shelley features and improvements\r\n\r\nNote that these include some Shelley-specific changes that were released earlier, but were not previously declared in the release notes.\r\n\r\n- Integrated the Shelley ledger with the consensus layer ([#258](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/258), [#982](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/982), [#1403](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/1403), [#1405](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/1405), [#1820](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/1820), [#1822](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/1822), [#1824](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1824))\r\n- Added Shelley support for the local state query ([#1442](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/1442), [#1848](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1848))\r\n- Added changes to prepare for the Shelley hard fork ([#1750](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1750), [#1775](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1775))\r\n- Added Shelley genesis file support (#798)\r\n- Added initial support for starting a node in Shelley mode (#820)\r\n- Added initial support for loading Shelley node leader credentials (#832)\r\n- Added support for reading/writing human-readable Shelley key file formats (#826, #829)\r\n- Improved Shelley ledger integration ([#1963](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1963), [#1821](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/1821), [#1967](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1967), [#1984](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1984), [#1986](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1986))\r\n- Added verification of avoidance of excessive memory use in Shelley ledger state ([#1558](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/1558), [#1928](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/1928))\r\n -
